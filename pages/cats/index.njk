<h1>Pictures of Cats</h1>

<p class="util-visually-hidden">
  I do apologize if you can't see the cat pictures. I didn't add alt text to the
  images because there are a lot of them, and I doubt that descriptions of cats
  are interesting to read or hear. Most of them would just say "Goose looking
  concerned about something", "Barry flopped over on his back, exposing his
  fuzzy belly", or "The brothers cuddling in an adorable way".
