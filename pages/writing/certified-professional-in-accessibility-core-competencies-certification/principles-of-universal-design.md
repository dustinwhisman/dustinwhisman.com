# CPACC Notes: Principles of Universal Design

_I'm studying for the CPACC certification. These are some of the notes I've taken recently._

## Equitable Use

When possible, provide the same means of use for all users, or at least provide an equivalent alternative (while avoiding segregation or stigmatization). Designs should be appealing to all users, and all users should be able to expect the same level of privacy, security, and safety.

For example, using a ramp instead of stairs would work for everybody, but having a ramp alongside stairs would also be fine. Having a ramp in the back alley of the building that goes to a completely different entrance would be far less equitable.

## Flexibility in Use

Design things to be adaptable so that users have choice in how to use them, like scissors that can be used with either hand. Account for variations in accuracy, precision, and pace. The fewer ways to use something there are, the more people will be unable to use that thing.

## Simple and Intuitive Use

Avoid complexity when possible, make sure expectations match reality, and keep things consistent and intuitive. Arrange information based on importance and relevance, and provide feedback while doing or completing tasks.

This applies to things like digital interfaces, but common objects like remote controls and shower knobs come to mind as well (the feedback is freezing/scalding water).

## Perceptible Information

Provide visual, audio, and tactile modes of presentation for essential information (e.g. signs, announcements, and braille). Provide adequate color contrast and maximize legibility of information.

Train stations and airports come to mind, where there are signs everywhere and frequent announcements. A tactile example would be raised bumps in the floor for train platforms to keep people from wandering onto the tracks.

## Tolerance for Error

Minimize hazards and risks for errors, and provide warnings for those hazards. Provide failsafe features and make tasks that require vigilance hard to do unconsciously or by accident.

Some activities are inherently risky, like driving or operating heavy machinery, which is why some medications warn against performing those activities. Otherwise, make sure the self-destruct button can’t accidentally be pressed while trying to do something else.

## Low Physical Effort

Don’t require awkward/straining body positions. Limit the amount of force it requires to operate things, and minimize repetitive actions and sustained physical effort. For digital interfaces, [Fitt’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law) comes to mind to minimize fatigue from mouse navigation, and skip links can minimize repetitive tabbing.

## Size and Space for Approach and Use

Ensure important elements are visible from a seated or standing position, and ensure components are within reach from those positions and accommodate different hand/grip sizes. Provide space for assistive devices or personal assistance.

On vacation a few years ago, I stayed at an apartment whose owner used a wheelchair, so the oven and all the cabinets were much closer to the ground. The default kitchen setup of three foot high stove tops and cabinets whose lowest shelves are five feet off the ground is a real issue for many people. I know a lot of short people with step stools in their kitchens, is what I’m saying.
