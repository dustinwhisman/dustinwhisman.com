# CPACC Notes: Accessibility Standards and Laws

_I'm studying for the CPACC certification. These are some of the notes I've taken recently._

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

This is a non-comprehensive overview of the various laws, treaties, standards, guidelines etc. as they relate to accessibility.

## International Declarations and Conventions on Disability Rights

People with disabilities were not included in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but in 1975, the UN passed the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. This was a nice gesture, if largely toothless, providing only recommendations but no enforcement mechanisms to ensure people with disabilities’ rights were protected. in 2006, the UN’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provided more of a legal framework for recognizing and protecting the rights of people with disabilities.

The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (or just The Marrakesh Treaty for short) was adopted in 2013, and it mandates making books and printed materials accessible to blind/low-vision folks.

## Regional Instruments on Human and Disability Rights

These regional charters and laws add to the international framework of disability rights.

- Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: in addition to basic human rights, this aims to ensure integration into society and non-discrimination for people with disabilities
- The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights: every individual is entitled to rights and freedoms, regardless of any status
- The Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities: eliminate discrimination and ensure integration into society

## National and Provincial Instruments on Disability Rights

These national and state/province laws and acts further protect people with disabilities.

- The Equality Act 2010: UK civil rights law protecting people with many characteristics including disability
- The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA): US civil rights law specifically protecting people with disabilities
- Ontarians with Disabilities Act of 2001: Ontario civil rights law, similar to the others mentioned earlier

## Domain-Specific and Government Procurement Laws and Regulations

These laws/regulations cover specific industries/domains.

- Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) of 2010: more or less requires captions on broadcast TV
- Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2017: sets accessibility requirements for air travel
- EN 301 549: EU procurement law that sets accessibility requirements for public sector digital interfaces
- Section 508: US procurement law setting accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA, maybe 2.2 implicitly) for services provided to government agencies
