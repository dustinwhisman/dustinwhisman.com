# CPACC Study Guide

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

Since getting my [Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) certification](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification), I've been wanting to get the [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) certification](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional) as well, which would then automatically grant me the [Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA) certification](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional-web-accessibility). So many acronyms!

Last time, I broke my studying into "sprints" based on what I thought made sense for grouping related topics together. I'm not doing that this time around, mostly because there seems to be less material for CPACC than WAS to go through, and partially because the grouping was an arbitrary way to measure progress that didn't really make sense. I've ranked them based on when they will be most useful for studying, which is why I have sample questions on the list twice–once as a pretest and once as a way to gauge readiness.

The Deque course is the only paid resource in this list, and I'm putting it near the end of the list, since it seems like the most useful resource. It's also quite a bit cheaper than the equivalent WAS course was, so that's nice.

It's recommended to spend 5-10 hours per week for 6-8 weeks to prepare for the CPACC exam, which I think was the same recommendation for the WAS exam. I probably overprepared for WAS, so we'll see how this time around goes–I'm expecting it to be somewhat easier in some ways (less technical) but harder in other ways (more legalese and memorization).
