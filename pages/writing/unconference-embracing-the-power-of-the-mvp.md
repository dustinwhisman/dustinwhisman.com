# UnConference: Embracing the Power of the MVP

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

On May 16th, 2024, Sparkbox will hosting a 2 hour online UnConference all about the power of Minimum Viable Products. It starts at 1pm EDT, so go ahead and [reserve your spot](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/embracing-the-power-of-the-mvp-tickets-880365024487) if you're interested.

I regularly work with the folks who are presenting, so I can vouch for themâ€”they know their stuff.

- Rob (Sparkbox President): Keynote
- Leah (Experience Design Director): Roadmapping
- Natalie (Projects Director): Managing Scope Creep
- Catherine (Technical Director): Creating a Technical Foundation

I've also [written about MVPs for the Foundry](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/MVP_mindset_progressive_enhancement_minimum_viable_experience_MVP_process_and_tooling_decisions), and so have [lots of other Sparkboxers](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/category/mvp), so go check those articles out if you like making sure you build the right thing while building the thing right.
