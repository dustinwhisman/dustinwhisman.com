# Notes: The Coaching Habit

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

I'm at a point in my career where I'm starting to accumulate more leadership responsibilities besides writing code. As such, I recently read _The Coaching Habit_ by Michael Bungay Stanier to help with mentoring other developers (both formally and informally). Here are the notes I took along the way.

- Ask 1 question at a time, then wait for the answer
- Leave silence so others can fill it
- Kickstart Question
  - What’s on your mind?
  - Focus on the project, people, or patterns as different facets of whatever issue there is
- The AWE Question
  - And what else?
  - In general, ask this 3-5 times
  - Use “Is there anything else?” as a wrap-up question, inviting closure
- The Focus Question
  - What's the real challenge here for you?
  - Better to ask questions starting with ”what” instead of “why”
- The Foundation Question
  - What do you want?
  - This one is okay to answer yourself after asking someone else
  - TERA: acronym for making situations feel safe
    - Tribe: are you on my side?
    - Expectation: do I know what's going to happen?
    - Rank: are you more or less important than me? (definitely don't want to diminish people)
    - Autonomy: do I get a say?
- The Lazy Question
  - How can I help?
  - Alternately: Out of curiosity/Just to be clear… what do you want from me?
  - The answer to their request can be Yes, No, Not that but maybe this, or I'll look into it/think about it
- The Strategic Question
  - If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?
  - Say yes more slowly, after asking these questions
    - Why are you asking me?
    - Who else have you asked?
    - When you say this is urgent, what do you mean?
    - According to what standard does this need to be completed? By when?
    - If I couldn’t do all of this, but could do just a part, what part would you have me do?
    - What do you want me to take off my plate so I can do this?
- The Learning Question
  - What was most useful for you?
