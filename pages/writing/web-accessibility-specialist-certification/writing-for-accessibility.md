# WAS Notes: Writing For Accessibility

_I'm studying for the WAS certification. These are some of the notes I've taken recently._

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

- Provide informative, unique page titles that go from more specific to less specific
  - “Page Name - Page Section - Site Name”
  - “Buy Your Thing (Step 1 of 3) - E-commerce Site”
- Use headings to convey meaning and structure, breaking up walls of text and providing easy-to-follow outlines
- Make link text meaningful by:
  - Avoiding “click here” or “read more” links
  - Including file information for download links, like “Massive File (PDF, 30MB)”
- Write meaningful alt text for images
  - If they’re purely decorative, then use `alt=""`
  - Think about what the image is meant to convey and use your words to describe that information
- Create transcripts for audio-only and captions for video
  - Transcripts should also describe visual information as applicable
  - Captions should also describe non-verbal audio, like sounds that off-screen or aren't visually obvious, like doors creaking
- Provide clear instructions by:
  - Avoiding jargon
  - Clearly labeling form controls
  - Describing input requirements
  - Using good error messages
- Keep content clear and concise by:
  - Using simple language
  - Writing short sentences/paragraphs
  - Expanding acronyms when first used
  - Providing glossaries and other media (images, videos, etc.) to clarify meaning
