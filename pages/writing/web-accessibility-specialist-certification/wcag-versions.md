# WAS Notes: WCAG Versions

_I'm studying for the WAS certification. These are some of the notes I've taken recently._

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

- WCAG 2.0 was published in December 2008
- WCAG 2.1 was published in July 2018. All requirements from 2.0 are in 2.1 (unchanged)
- WCAG 2.2 is in the works (at time of writing). All requirements from 2.0 and 2.1 will be in 2.2 (unchanged)
- These subsequent version numbers only add new success criteria, so if you meet the 2.1 criteria, you also meet the 2.0 criteria
  - [New in 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/)
  - [New in 2.2 Draft](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/)
- WCAG 3 is an early draft (at time of writing) and will take a **\***while**\*** before it is published
- The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative. Or put another way: WCAG is developed by the AG WG, which is part of the W3C WAI.
