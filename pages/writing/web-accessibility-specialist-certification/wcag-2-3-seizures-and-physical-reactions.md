# WAS Notes: WCAG 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions

_I'm studying for the WAS certification. These are some of the notes I've taken recently._

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

## 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold - Level A

Content does not contain anything that flashes more than three times per second, or the flashes are below general and red flash thresholds.

### How to Succeed

- Ensure that nothing flashes more than three times per second
- Keep any flashing areas small (counted as up to 25% of any 10-degree visual field)
- Use flash analysis tools to determine if flashes meet the necessary thresholds

## 2.3.2 Three Flashes- Level AAA

Content does not contain anything that flashes more than three times per second. This removes the threshold exception from 2.3.1.

## 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions - Level AAA

Motion animations that are triggered by interaction can be disabled unless they are essential.

### How to Succeed

- Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query appropriately
- Give users an option to prevent animation
