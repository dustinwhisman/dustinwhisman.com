# WAS Notes: ATAG Guidelines

_I'm studying for the WAS certification. These are some of the notes I've taken recently._

## Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0

[ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/) specifies principles that authoring tools should follow to make creating accessible web content easier–for example, prompting users to add alt text to images. The focus of ATAG is to ensure that the authoring tools themselves are accessible, and that they support creating accessible content.

Can a website be an authoring tool? Yes! For example, a social media website and a no-code CMS would both be considered authoring tools. If users can create web content through it, it’s an authoring tool.

### Part A: Make the authoring tool user interface accessible

Authoring tools should be usable according to WCAG, but with some extras that apply specifically to authoring tools. Most of these should sound familiar if you know about WCAG.

- A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines for web-based content and non-web-based content
- A.2: Editing-views are perceivable
- A.3: Editing-views are operable
- A.4: Editing-views are understandable

### Part B: Support the production of accessible content

Authoring tools should make creating accessible content easy and by default. The standard output of the tool should be accessible, and users should be given prompts and guidance to fix accessibility problems with their content.

- B.1: Fully automatic processes produce accessible content
- B.2: Authors are supported in producing accessible content
- B.3: Authors are supported in improving the accessibility of existing content
- B.4: Authoring tools promote and integrate their accessibility features
