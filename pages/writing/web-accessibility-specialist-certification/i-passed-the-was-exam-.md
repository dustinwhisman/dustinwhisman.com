# I Passed the WAS Exam!

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

I just got the news today, and I passed the Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)
exam! The certification should help serve as evidence that I know what I'm
talking about regarding web accessibility, and it should open some professional
doors. For example, if Sparkbox gets a client who needs an accessibility audit
performed, I'm one of a handful of people who would be trusted to do that type
of work.

This is the culmination of years of work experience and hundreds of hours of
studying, which I'm very happy paid off. Next up,
[CPACC](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional)! I'm
going for that [CPWA
certification](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional-web-accessibility),
even if it's not strictly necessary.
