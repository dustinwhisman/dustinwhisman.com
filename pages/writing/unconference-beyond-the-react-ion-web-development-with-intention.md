# UnConference: Beyond the React-ion: Web Development with Intention

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

Next week, on June 12th at 2-4 Eastern time, I'm going to be giving a talk with Jon Oliver (not that one) for Sparkbox's UnConference for this quarter. Our talk is the keynote and will cover the web development landscape in 2025, covering everything from React to... not React. Spoiler alert, I'll be advocating for web standards based approaches and Jon will highlight some ways to use React as best as you can.

There are two other, shorter talks planned from Rise Erpelding about progressive enhancement and Kasey Bonifacio about how web development has changed over the years. [Here are more details and the sign-up form](https://us1.list-manage.com/survey?u=c2fcafb7ccc2db34e99075bb1&id=bbe9580703&attribution=false), so feel free to join us live or watch the talks after the fact!

I'll leave some supporting articles here, and once the videos and resources are live, I'll add them in as well:

- [The React Rendering Landscape in 2025](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/the-react-rendering-landcape-in-2025)
- [The Landscape Beyond React](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/landscape_beyond_react)
- [JSX Beyond React: An Intro to SolidJS](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/jsx_beyond_react_an_introduction_to_solidjs_for_developers)
