# Reviewing my Garmin watch after using it for a year

{% include 'partials/published-date.njk' %}

I bought a Garmin watch on a whim one year ago, and having used it daily and completing two of the half-marathon training plans, I figured now was as good a time as any to review it. The model that I bought was a Forerunner 265, which seemed like a good-enough, running-focused option without a bunch of expensive extra features that I wouldn’t use.

## Cost

The watch cost $489.63 (including taxes, shipping, etc.) when I bought it, and that’s the entirety of what I’ve spent for it. The Garmin Connect app, which is what you use for choosing training plans, looking at stats, and a bunch of other things, is thankfully free to use, and there’s no subscription required to actually use the thing for its intended purpose.

There is a subscription available, called Connect+ or something like that, but it seems to be mainly for giving you access to more badges you can earn (don’t care), and maybe different activities? None of it has seemed essential to me, so I haven’t looked into it.

It seems very much like they make their money from the hardware, not the app (they don’t even run ads), so while it’s not _not_ expensive, it’s a one time cost, so I’m fine with it.

## Charts, data, and numbers

The watch records a lot of data throughout the day, such as steps, heart rate, respiration, etc., and there are tons of screens in the app and on the watch to visualize that data, and they mostly explain what the numbers mean. I still don’t understand what HRV is about or how to make it better, but for the most part, you can tell when it’s good that number go up or number go down.

The main charts that I still end up looking at often are the body battery chart and the sleep chart. The body battery chart is a metaphor for how you’re doing overall, so a high number means you are well rested, not stressed, and have plenty of energy to do stuff, and a low number means you should probably go to bed. The sleep chart is self-explanatory, and it shows when you’re in different phases of sleep, like light sleep, deep sleep, REM, or awake because your cat decided 4 in the morning is the time to try to get into your closet.

In the first couple months, the body battery and stress charts became a sort of feedback loop for me, where I’d look at the chart and it would say I was stressed, which would stress me out, and then I’d keep looking at it. Eventually, I learned to just ignore it for the most part, since the things that were most likely to show up as stress were things like eating lunch or just existing after going for a run.

Speaking of runs, after every workout, you get a little summary of your activity with a bunch more charts that are theoretically useful. I mostly just look at them and go "neat" before moving on, or take a screenshot if there’s something notable, like if the watch estimated that I sweat over 2 liters during a long run. Yeah, it estimates sweat loss, and I rue the day that I found that out.

For a certain type of nerd, all this data is a gold mine, but I mostly just check a few things regularly and only dig into some of the more obscure stats when I get curious.

## Training Plans

I’ve completed two of the three half-marathon plans that are created by real live human coaches, and I’ve had mixed results with trying out robot Garmin’s adaptive plans. I haven’t tried the third coach’s half-marathon plan because it’s based around a walk-run strategy, and I don’t want to do that.

### Coach Greg’s plan

The first plan I finished was Coach Greg’s plan, which averaged 4 workouts per week, which were mostly time based. For example, run for 50 minutes at a 9:30 pace, or do intervals at faster paces with recovery sections in between. I was able to accomplish my goal, which was to complete a half-marathon in under 2 hours without walking any of it. It could have gone better, though.

During all of the training runs, the watch would show my pace and alert me if I was going faster or slower than I was supposed to be. However, when it came time to actually run the half-marathon, the watch just displayed the miles remaining and a timer, so I had no pace information except for once per mile, when it would announce how fast that particular mile was. This meant that I started way too fast and crashed out hard by the end. Only later did I find out that you could push a button on the watch to switch to a different screen that shows your current pace. Oops.

### Coach Amy’s plan

For some important context, the app has a race predictor feature that said I could run a half-marathon in 1hr 43min. I thought that seemed unlikely, so I opted for a less ambitious, but still quite ambitious time of 1hr 50min. My assumption was that the plan would adjust accordingly, but most training runs (5 times per week this time around) had me going at a 10 minute pace, and very few runs at anything near what my race pace would need to be to hit that time.

For the second half-marathon, I switched to the screen that shows the pace, so I paced myself better. However, it became clear around the halfway point that there was no way I’d be able to maintain the pace needed to finish under my goal time. I slowed down a bit to avoid crashing at the end again. As a result, I shaved a grand total of *22 seconds* off my previous time, which is impressive in its own way but still a little disappointing.

I liked the structure of Amy’s plan better than Greg’s, since the workouts were all mileage based, rather than time based, and they followed a nice, predictable sequence week to week. The main thing I would change is the pace, since I think I could have done better had my training runs been a little bit faster.

### Robot Garmin’s plan

Between those training plans, I’ve used the automatically suggested workouts that robot Garmin comes up with, and I’ve started and stopped robot Garmin training plans for 5k and 10k races a few different times. I’ve just run into issues that might be circumstantial, or they might just be how those plans work.

For example, after I got back from a three week vacation, I was trying to ramp back up to my normal weekly mileage, but robot Garmin kept scheduling recovery runs even though I felt fine and wanted to run more. I think that’s when I switched to Coach Amy’s plan, since I knew it would start with preset workouts.

The main issue with robot Garmin has been that it will plan workouts that are ridiculously difficult, like a run that has you do three 7 minute intervals at basically your fastest mile’s pace, or way too easy, like a 33 minute base run on your long run day. I recently learned that you can target heart rate instead of pace for those plans, so I’m trying that with the robot Garmin marathon plan. So far, it’s helped make the difficult runs more reasonable, but it is annoying when your heart rate doesn’t immediately go back down to the intended level during recovery intervals and the watch keeps yelling at you about it.

The robot Garmin workouts also change constantly, since they’re supposed to adapt to your physical condition. This ends up being really annoying, though, since you can’t plan around them. They show up on the app a week in advance, but if you have a night of mediocre sleep, it’ll just change up whatever you were supposed to do to something easier. That sounds nice, but it kind of works against the goal of persevering through challenges and dealing with adverse conditions, no?

Unfortunately, the human-curated plans only go up to half-marathon distance, so robot Garmin is the only option if you want to train for a full marathon. I’ll report back if I end up doing that, or I’ll just make a spreadsheet from some online training plan and manually add those workouts.

## But is it any good

I’m pretty happy with the purchase, and I can genuinely say it’s made a meaningful difference in my health and running habits. I know of four people in my orbit who have bought their own Garmin watches after I bought mine, so I guess my word of mouth has been working. (This isn't a sponsored post, but if a check shows up in the mail, I will cash it.)

I’d recommend them with the caveat that I use mine mainly for running and can’t speak to any of the other features, like for strength training or yoga or whatever. But if you’re a runner and want to try out some different training plans or just track your data, this watch is worth a try.
