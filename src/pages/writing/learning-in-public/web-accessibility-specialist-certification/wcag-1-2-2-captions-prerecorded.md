## Level A

Captions are provided for audio content in synchronized media, unless the media is clearly labeled as an alternative for text.

### How to Succeed

- Provide open captions (always visible)
- Provide closed captions (can be activated by the user)
- Techniques for video players differ, but for the `video` element in HTML, the `track` element works

### How to Fail

- Omit some dialogue or important sound effects from captions
- Omit captions entirely when there is no suitable text alternative
- Donâ€™t label the video as an alternative to text when they both communicate the same information
