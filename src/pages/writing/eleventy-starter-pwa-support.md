# Building an Eleventy Starter Template: Progressive Web App Support

In 2022, I wrote a series of articles for [Sparkbox's
Foundry](https://sparkbox.com/foundry) about how to build a starter template for
Eleventy. The real goal of the series was to cover all of the architectural
decisions that you need to make when starting a project, like choosing your
build tools, setting up testing and linting, and supporting as many browsers as
possible without putting too much burden on developers.

I chose Eleventy for this because I like working with it and because it doesn't
give you a whole lot out of the box, as opposed to something like Next.js or
Astro, where there's a lot more support for bundling JS and such.

This article goes over a minimal approach to turn an Eleventy site into a
Progressive Web App. You can read [the article on the
Foundry](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/eleventy_starter_repo_series_teaches_progressive_web_app_support_PWA)
or go to the [landing page for the whole
series](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/series/building_an_eleventy_starter_template).
